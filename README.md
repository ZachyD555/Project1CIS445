# Project 1 for CIS 445/545

## Here is the GitHub repository for my Project 1!
This website contains five different "pages" that you access by simply scrolling. There is also a menu tab that remains at the top of the screen no matter how far down you end up scrolling.

My css file, html file, and javascript file are all located in Project1CIS445/dist
index.html is the file that my website is using.
