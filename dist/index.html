                            Hello, and welcome to my personal website. This is the very beginning of this site so it is 
                            fairly small. Within this site, you will find information about my areas of study, some information about 
                            myself that you might find interesting, and my work experience. I hope that this website is informative and helpful. 
                            In this website you will notice a couple of features for better information access:

                            <li>Bootstrap's scrollspy feature which highlights which section of the page you're on in the navbar</li>

                            I am currently a super senior at Bradley University where I am hoping to graduate with a major in Theatre Performance and a minor in Computer Science. 
                            I first came to Bradley with my minor instead being a major in Electrical Engineering. 
                            I moved to Central Illinois from Kansas City back in the 4<sup>th</sup> grade. 
                            After I finish and graduate Bradley here in the Spring of 2022, I plan to move to Chicago and start networking as an actor, 
                            while using my CS minor to pick up work every now and then.

                        <p class="lead">I have been acting for almost as long as I can remember. All the way back in grade-school I can remember going onto the stage
                            and falling in love with the theatre. I carried this passion for acting all the way through middle and high-school, up to college where
                            I decided to make Performing Arts my major. I have performed for my high-school theatre, Bradley University, and my community theatre company: 
                            ArcLight Productions.

                        <h3>Why Theatre?</h3>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Why did I choose theatre? To say that it makes me happy would be an understatement. You talked in class about how this is a passion of yours. Well, I suppose the best 
                            way to answer the question would be to say that acting is my true passion and without it, I really can’t say that I would be the person that I am today. 
                            If you look at all the pictures above, you can see that I have been in a variety of shows. It is this “flexibility of reality” that I have truly fallen in love with. 
                            To me, the ability to become different characters and convey a story through their actions and choices is one of the most 
                            satisfying and rewarding things about the Theatre. Theatre allows people to tell stories and send messages in ways that are almost 
                            impossible for other forms of art.

                        <p class="lead">
                            Computers have always been a huge part of my life. From when I was younger and would play games with my dad to more recently 
                            where I find myself more and more interested with the idea of coding and web-design. Throughout my years here at Bradley, I have picked 
                            up multiple different coding languages. The languages that I am most confident in are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python</li>

                        <p class="lead">
                            I also have some basic experience with the following languages:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Linux</li>
                            <li>HTML</li>

                        <h4>My CS Future</h4>
                        <p class="lead">
                            Upon graduation in the coming semester, my plan for integrating CS into my life is this: 
                            Once I move to Chicago I plan to search for possible CS jobs around the Chicago area whch will 
                            allow me to work from home. With this stipulation, I will be able to easily fit any show process 
                            into my work schedule. I also have hopes to implement and incorporate more Computer Scientists into 
                            the world of theatre both behind the scenes and on the stage.
